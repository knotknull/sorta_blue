Data does not leave an Azure region unless specifically executed to.


## Resiliency and Availability (within a region)
##

36 Regions w/ additional 8 coming soon

 - Single VM

 - Availability Set:  2 or more fault domains (share common power source & network switch)
        - VMs in Availability distributed across fault domains
            - across physical servers, compute racks, storage and network switches

 - Availability Zone:  Different physical zones (datacenters) within
                       Azure region (geographic area)
                       Helps prevent datacenter loss
                       (Currently preview)

 - Paired Region :  Protect against regional outage.  Deploy app across multiple
                    regions. Azure Traffic Manager to distribute traffice across
                    regions. Regions within a Paried Region are located within
                    the same geography. (Exception is Brazil South Region)

    NOTE: Need to take into account latency across regions !!

## Subscriptions
##
Subscription:  An agreement with Microsoft to use one or more cloud platforms
               or services.  Pay for services on consumption model.

  - Organizations can have multiple Azure Subscriptions
        -env / geography based / function based

  - Subscriptions integrate with Azure Active Directory
      - multiple subscriptions can trust one directory
      - a subscription can trust only one directory

  - Azure resources will reside within a subscription

## Azure Resource Manager
##

Azure Resource Manager: Underlying service for deploying and managing resources
      in Azure.
Terminology:
  Resources:  Manageable items available for Azure.
     VMs, Storage Acct, Web Apps, DBs, virtual network

Resource Groups:  Where to deploy resources. Container of related resources.
  If deploying resources for an app together than resources should belong to
  the same resource group

Resource Providers: Service that supplies the resources available to
  Resource Manager.
    Product groups create a Resource Provider for the product.
      i.e. Microsoft dot compute , dot storage

Resource Manager Templates:  JSON file that defines one or more resources to
  deploy to a Resource Group.  Resource template for cloud services.
   - defines dependencies between resources
   - deploy same dev / test / prod
   - Infrastructure as Code (like Cloud Formation)
