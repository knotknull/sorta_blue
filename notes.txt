Data does not leave an Azure region unless specifically executed to.


## Resiliency and Availability (within a region)
##

36 Regions w/ additional 8 coming soon

 - Single VM

 - Availability Set:  2 or more fault domains (share common power source & network switch)
        - VMs in Availability distributed across fault domains
            - across physical servers, compute racks, storage and network switches

 - Availability Zone:  Different physical zones (datacenters) within
                       Azure region (geographic area)
                       Helps prevent datacenter loss
                       (Currently preview)

 - Paired Region :  Protect against regional outage.  Deploy app across multiple
                    regions. Azure Traffic Manager to distribute traffice across
                    regions. Regions within a Paried Region are located within
                    the same geography. (Exception is Brazil South Region)

    NOTE: Need to take into account latency across regions !!

## Subscriptions
##
Subscription:  An agreement with Microsoft to use one or more cloud platforms
               or services.  Pay for services on consumption model.

  - Organizations can have multiple Azure Subscriptions
        -env / geography based / function based

  - Subscriptions integrate with Azure Active Directory
      - multiple subscriptions can trust one directory
      - a subscription can trust only one directory

  - Azure resources will reside within a subscription

## Azure Resource Manager
##

Azure Resource Manager: Underlying service for deploying and managing resources
      in Azure.
Terminology:
  Resources:  Manageable items available for Azure.
     VMs, Storage Acct, Web Apps, DBs, virtual network

Resource Groups:  Where to deploy resources. Container of related resources.
  If deploying resources for an app together than resources should belong to
  the same resource group

Resource Providers: Service that supplies the resources available to
  Resource Manager.
    Product groups create a Resource Provider for the product.
      i.e. Microsoft dot compute , dot storage

Resource Manager Templates:  JSON file that defines one or more resources to
  deploy to a Resource Group.  Resource template for cloud services.
   - defines dependencies between resources
   - deploy same dev / test / prod
   - Infrastructure as Code (like Cloud Formation)


##########################################################################
##  Azure Services
##########################################################################
  - Virtual Machines
  - App Service
  - Functions
  - Batch
  - Container Services
  - Container Instances
  - Service Fabric
  - Cloud Services


##  Azure Compute
##

Windows / Linux VM on demand

Distros: CentOS, CoreOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, RHEL, SUSE LES, openSUSE, Ubuntu

Can use a virual hard disk (VHD) as well

 - 6 Types of VM (storage optimized, IO optimized, etc.)
 - 28 Families
 - set amount of vCPUs, Memory, Temporary Storage
      - can attach data disks
 - billed per minute
 - Reserved VM Instances gives significant discount
 - similar to EC2


##  Azure Service
##

- Platform as a Service
- Completely managed environment
- .Net, .Net Core, Java, Ruby, Node.JS, PHP or Python
- Web Apps / APIs / Mobile Backends / Containers
- Windows and Linux

App Service Plans:  from Free to Isolated Environments


##  Azure Functions
##

- Serverless Compute - run code on demand
- Function as a Service (like Lambda)
- Execute code in response to events or Triggers
- Only pay when your code is executed
- Languages:  C#, F#, Javascript, Node.js, Java

Part of App Service and can run within an App Service Plan

First 1 million executions / month free


##  Azure Batch
##

- Managed service for batch processing jobs
- Used for running large scale parallel and HPC workloads efficiently
- Scale processes to as many compute cores as required
- Supports both windows and linux compute nodes
- Batch is free, just pay for resources you are running


##  Azure Container Service (ACS) ==>> Azure Container Service for Kubernetes (AKS)
##

- Managed Kubernetes Container Orchestration
- Auto upgrades / patching
- Support for other orchestrators (but not managed)
  - DC/OS, Un-managed Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- Only pay for agent nodes not masters


##  Azure Container Instances
##
- Containers as a service  (good for only one container)
- Fast and easy way to run a container in Azure
- Containers get a public IP address
- Can design container spec yourself (CPU / RAM)
- Supports both windows and linux containers
- Per-second billing


##  Azure Service Fabric
##

- Orchestrator / Platform for running microservices / containers (not Kubernetes)
- Used by a lot of Azure and MS services
  - Skype for Business, Cortana, CosmosDB, Dynamics 365
- Can run anywhere, other clouds, on premises. SDK is identical
- Supports Stateful and Stateless microservices
- Popular among .Net community but supports other languages and containers too
- Utilizes high density container architecture for scale and performance


##  Azure Cloud Services (Classic Cloud Services)
##

- Original PaaS offering from Azure
- Similar to App Service but you can remote into the VMs and install software
- Web Roles - Websites
- Worker Roles - Async processing
- Recommended to use App Services instead of Cloud Services
